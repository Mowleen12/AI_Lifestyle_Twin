## 📌 Problem Statement
Most fitness apps provide generic, one-size-fits-all plans that do not match diverse needs such as Indian diets, allergies, home-based workouts, or busy schedules. As a result, users lose motivation and often quit within the first month.  
There is a need for a personalized, adaptive AI solution that understands users deeply and supports long-term health improvement.

## 💡 Solution
AI Lifestyle Twin acts as a smart digital coach that personalizes everything — from diet charts to workouts — based on your goals, preferences, and lifestyle.  
Using AI through the OpenRouter API, the app continuously adjusts plans based on weekly progress to ensure sustainable results.
